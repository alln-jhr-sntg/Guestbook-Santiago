# Allen Jheru Santiago (22013022410)- PHP Guestbook

A PHP-based guestbook web application powered by **MySQL** and running on **XAMPP**. This system allows users to post, edit, and delete entries stored securely in a database. The project demonstrates core PHP + MySQL development using modular includes and CRUD operations.

## ðŸš€ What's New in This Version

- âœ¨ **Database Integration**:
  - Switched from text file storage to **MySQL database**.
  - Guest entries are now securely stored and retrieved using SQL queries.

- âœ¨ **New Features**:
  - `edit.php`: Users can now **edit** guestbook entries directly from the interface.
  - `delete.php`: Users can **delete** entries with confirmation.
  - `nav.php`: Modular navigation bar added for a cleaner UI.
  - `config.php`: Centralized database configuration for scalability.

- ðŸ”§ **Improvements**:
  - Improved layout and organization in `index.php`.
  - Updated styles in `css/style.css`.
  - Modular includes for cleaner, reusable code (`header.php`, `footer.php`, `functions.php`).

- PHP
- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript (for dark mode)
